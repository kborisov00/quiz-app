# Quiz Application ðŸš€

> A Mobile/Tablet web app where users can pick a quiz and solve it. They will get points along the way and receive a score in the end.

### Application Requirements:
* A quiz has at least 10 questions. Some could be longer (like 100 questions)
* The user has 30 seconds to answer a question.
* One question has only one correct answer.
* After answering, the user can see if his answer is correct or wrong for 2 seconds, after which the next question comes up right away.
* While solving it, the user can see The timer, The total time, The score, Correct/Wrong answers.
* As the result, the user will see a message based on this score (think of 5 messages for 5 different categories)
* For each wrong answer, remove the same points, you would give if it was correct.
* The user canâ€™t have less than 0 points in the end.
* There will be a list of all available quizzes, which the user can pick from.
* You will be working only on the front-end, so you donâ€™t have to worry about storing that information. If you need to store something, use the user cache.

### Technical requirements:
* use webpack
* setup vercel demo
* do not use libraries if not neccesary
* code should be clean, formatted, structured, commented, with linters/hinters

### Each day:
* Post a progress screenshot, demo, repo and information on where you are at, what you will tackle for the day. 
* You can post questions and request for directions all the time.
* We will review the code/app every couple days.
